# Rumble Frontend (CDP 2.0 Task 2)

[Deployed in Versel](https://cdp-rumble-frontend.vercel.app/) ðŸš€

For detailed info on the architecture please check out the Readme in the [Backend Repo](https://github.com/CyberFlaw/cdp-rumble-backend)

This repo consists of the frontend code for Rumble Chatroom. This is built for TinkeHub Career Development Program 2.0

The Frontend is created in Next.JS as it's one of the most popular and easy-to-use Web frameworks which doesn't compromise on usability and developer experience and has the fastest build time among Javascript frameworks

The finished website will be hosted in Vercel

## Pending Work

I was unable to host the API due to some internal server issue in Render. So the fetch calls are not implemented. A few more quality improvements are also required

## How to run the code

- Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CyberFlaw/cdp-rumble-frontend.git
```

- Install all dependencies

```node
npm install
```

- Run the server in dev mode

```node
npm run dev
```
