# CDP Task 2 | Rumble

This repo consists of 2 folders

- [cdp-rumble-frontend](https://github.com/CyberFlaw/cdp-rumble-frontend)

- [cdp-rumble-backend](https://github.com/CyberFlaw/cdp-rumble-backend)

These two are initially made as 2 different repo due to the ease of deployment. This repo just binds together both the repo for submission.

The detailed docs for the architecture are provided in the backend repository and I'll be explaining it in great detail in the video. There are also large comments in the codebase where improvements are needed or features to be added

**Note**: I recommend following the original repo for both the software for cloning and testing. You can check out the stand-alone repos by clicking the hyperlinks shown above
